### What I learned üßê
___
I've learned a new type of input "range", which is important for interactivity with users, specially to collect and show info with variations. I've also seen 2 important events from these kind of input tags "input, changed events" and finally, I'd like to add that I have applied an interesting way to make an "animation" with linear-gradient.

```html
<input type="range" min="0" max="4" step="1" />
```

```js
const barElement = getElementById("barItself")

barElement.addEventListeener("input", changeInformation)
```

```css
#barItself{
    background-image: linear-gradient(to right, 
        hsla(174, 86%, 45%, 0.37) 0%, 
        hsla(174, 86%, 45%, 0.37) 25%, /*Here's the trick*/
        rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.37)0%
    );
}
```
